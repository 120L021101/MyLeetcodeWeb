    "description": "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.<br><br>    The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:<br>    <br>    <b>1. Whitespace</b>: Ignore any leading whitespace.<br><br>    <b>2. Signedness</b>: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.<br><br>    <b>3. Conversion</b>: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.<br><br>    <b>4. Rounding</b>: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.<br><br>    Return the integer as the final result.",
