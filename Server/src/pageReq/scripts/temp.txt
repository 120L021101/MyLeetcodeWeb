        <h2>Title: Find the Unique Element in the Arra</h2>  
        <p>Given an integer array where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single element and return it.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [2,2,3,2]\nOutput: 3\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]\nOutput: 99\n\nRequirements: Your algorithm should have linear time complexity. You may not use any extra space, but it is acceptable if you want to trade space for a faster solution.\n\nNote: This problem can be solved using bitwise operations. Consider how to leverage the fact that every number appears three times except for one</p>
